# resFLARE-FLARE
Let's analyze some results generated by FLARE üî•

* The structural details of each time step from the MD simulation resulted in cartesian coordinates of the atomic positions of the molecule. To determine different bonding parameters to characterize the molecular environment, we can use this script!

* Here we will be interested in looking at the,
  1. Bond length
     * Type of bonds
     * Minimum, maximum, and average bond distances
  3. Bond angles
  4. Dihedral angles
  5. Coordination numbers

* We are extracting bonding parameters with the use of another commercially available GitHub script, **_xyz2tab_**. To check further information on the **_xyz2tab_** script, please _**[CLICK HERE](https://github.com/radi0sus/xyz2tab.git)!**_
* Important to note that, a copy of the **_xyz2tab_** script needs to be in your file path before you can execute the following script!

> resFLARE - Step by step
1. Creating an environment suitable to perform the upcoming calculations!
   * Even though this script is written in the shell!, most of the heavy work will be done via Python-based scripts. Therefore we need to have appropriate libraries installed in the working environment.
   * Once you execute the **_resFLARE_** script, the first question that will pop up is whether you already have a suitable Python virtual environment with the libraries needed for the calculation (pandas, scipy, tabulate, matplotlib, and scikit-learn).
   * If you alrady have those installed, ypu and skip this step and move forward, or else you and ask the script to install them for you. It will generate a particular virtual environment specifically made to perform our analysis (Say YES! üëç).
3. User-defined inputs
   * The next big important thing is that the script will ask you the name of the file which contains your atomic coordinates along with the name of the molecule.
5. Dihedral angle?
   * Dihedral angle determination is user-defined, where the script will ask you whether you need to perform this extra step or not.
   * If you prefer to do some dihedral angle checking, the script will guide you to pick one from the following two options, Type 1: Atom1-Atom2-Atom3-Atom4, and Type 2: Atom1-Atom2-[...]-Atom2-Atom1.
   * After your choice, you can specify which atoms are you interested on checking the dihedral angles (ex. Au-S-C-H or Au-S-S-Au).
   * Once they are done, a dihedral angle calculation will take place.
7. Coordination number of atoms
