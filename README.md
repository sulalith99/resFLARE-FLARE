# resFLARE-FLARE
Let's analyze some results generated by FLARE ðŸ”¥

* The structural details of each time step from the MD simulation resulted in cartesian coordinates of the atomic positions of the molecule. To determine different bonding parameters to characterize the molecular environment, we can use this script!

* Here we will be interested in looking at the,
  1. Bond length
     * Type of bonds
     * Minimum, maximum, and average bond distances
  3. Bond angles
  4. Dihedral angles
  5. Coordination numbers

* We are extracting bonding parameters with the use of another commercially available GitHub script,**_xyz2tab_**. To check more information on the xyz2tab script, please **[https://github.com/radi0sus/xyz2tab.git]**!
